The Recipe Project (Updated)


PROJECT INTRODUCTION :

This is a foundational HTML project from TOP(the odin project). In this project, I aim to demonstrate all the foundational HTMLand CSS skills that I have learnt in the foundational course from TOP(the odin project). 

WHAT'S IN THE PROJECT? :

<> In this project, I have created a simple webpage where you can find recipes(2 at the moment). The recipes are linked via anchor element to another webpage that I have created that displays the recipe name, visuals(photo), ingredients and directions to make that particular recipe. 

<> In this project, I have used multiple basic HTML tags and elements(learnt from the HTML foundational course in TOP) which includes, :

   1. Heading Tags
   2. Paragraph Tags
   3. Image Tags & its attributes - src(path for an image), alt(alternate text for an image if the image does not load)
   4. Bold and Italic Tags
   5. Anchor Element & its attributes - href (Hyper Text Refrence), target(to open a new tab upon clicking th link)
   6. Unordered and Ordered HTML lists.

<> In this latest version of the project, I have applied my basic CSS foundational skills that I learnt from TOP(the odin project), this includes, :

   1. Selectors(element selectors, class selectors)
   2. Grouping and Chaining Selectors.
   3. Use of various declarations(he key-value pair of a CSS property and its value) such as font-size, font-style, etc,.
   4. Basic use of block vs inline.
   4. Lastly, applying the key/importnt concept of The Box Model which includes declarations such as border, padding, margin etc,.
