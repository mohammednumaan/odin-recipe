The Recipe Project


PROJECT INTRODUCTION :

This is a foundational HTML project from TOP(the odin project). In this project, I aim to demonstrate all the foundational HTML skills that I have learnt in the foundational course from TOP(the odin project). 

WHAT'S IN THE PROJECT? :

<> In this project, I have created a simple webpage where you can find recipes(2 at the moment). The recipes are linked via anchor element to another webpage that I have created that displays the recipe name, visuals(photo), ingredients and directions to make that particular recipe.

<> In this project, I have used multiple basic HTML tags and elements(learnt from the HTML foundational course in TOP) which includes, :

   1. Heading Tags
   2. Paragraph Tags
   3. Image Tags & its attributes - src(path for an image), alt(alternate text for an image if the image does not load)
   4. Bold and Italic Tags
   5. Anchor Element & its attributes - href (Hyper Text Refrence), target(to open a new tab upon clicking th link)
   6. Unordered and Ordered HTML lists using the <ul> and <ol> tags.

1. Learnt how to structure a HTML document.
2. Learnt how to apply various HTML tags and elements in HTML webpages.
3. Learnt how to link and use images in a HTML webpage.
